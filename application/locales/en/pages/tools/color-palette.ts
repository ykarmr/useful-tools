    {
      q: "What are the different palette types?",
      a: "Monochromatic uses variations of one hue, analogous uses adjacent colors on the color wheel, complementary uses opposite colors, triadic uses three equally spaced colors, and tetradic uses four colors forming a rectangle on the color wheel.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does color blind simulation work?",
      a: "The tool simulates three types of color vision deficiency: protanopia (red-blind), deuteranopia (green-blind), and tritanopia (blue-blind). This helps ensure your palette is accessible to users with color vision differences.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is luminance and why is it important?",
      a: "Luminance measures the perceived brightness of a color (0-100%). It's crucial for determining text-background contrast ratios to meet accessibility standards like WCAG guidelines.",
    },
    {
      q: "How can I use the exported CSS variables?",
      a: "Copy the exported CSS variables into your stylesheet's :root selector. You can then use them throughout your CSS like 'color: var(--color-1)' for consistent theming.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I input colors in RGB or HSL format?",
      a: "Currently, you can only input colors in HEX format (#RRGGBB), but the tool displays colors in HEX, RGB, and HSL formats. You can copy colors in any of these formats.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between HEX, RGB, and HSL?",
      a: "HEX uses hexadecimal notation (#FF0000), RGB uses red-green-blue values (0-255), and HSL uses hue (0-360Â°), saturation (0-100%), and lightness (0-100%). Each format serves different design and development purposes.",
