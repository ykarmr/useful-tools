    {
      q: "What is number base conversion?",
      a: "Number base conversion is representing the same numerical value using different number systems (bases). It's commonly used in programming since computers operate in binary.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is binary (base 2)?",
      a: "Binary is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It's the fundamental language of computers, where each digit represents a bit.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is hexadecimal commonly used?",
      a: "Hexadecimal provides a compact way to represent binary numbers. Each hex digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits, making it easier to read long binary sequences.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are bit operations?",
      a: "Bit operations are logical operations performed on individual bits. They include AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations and bit shifting, commonly used for efficient programming.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is ASCII?",
      a: "ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that assigns numerical values to characters for computer processing.",
    },
