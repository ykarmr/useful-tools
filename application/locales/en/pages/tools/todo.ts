      q: "How should I set task priorities?",
      a: "Consider both urgency and importance. Set 'High' for urgent and important tasks, 'Medium' for important tasks with normal deadlines, and 'Low' for tasks with flexible timelines. The Eisenhower Matrix concept can be helpful as a reference.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens when a task with a due date becomes overdue?",
      a: "Overdue tasks are highlighted in red and display an 'Overdue' label. This helps you quickly identify tasks that need immediate attention.",
    },
    {
      q: "I accidentally deleted a task. Can I restore it?",
      a: "Unfortunately, there's currently no restore function for deleted tasks. Please be careful when deleting important tasks.",
    },
    {
      q: "Where is my data stored?",
      a: "All task data is stored in your browser's local storage. Nothing is sent to external servers, ensuring your privacy is protected. However, tasks will be lost if you clear your browser data.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I sync tasks across multiple devices?",
      a: "Currently, cross-device task synchronization is not available. Tasks are managed independently on each device.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I categorize tasks?",
      a: "There's currently no category feature, but you can include tags in task names for organization (e.g., '[Work] Prepare meeting materials').",
    },
    {
      q: "How is the progress bar calculated?",
      a: "The progress bar shows the percentage of completed tasks divided by total tasks. It provides a visual overview of your overall progress.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I manage a large number of tasks at once?",
      a: "While there's no technical limit, for efficient task management, we recommend keeping active tasks to around 20-30 items at a time.",
