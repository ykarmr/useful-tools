      q: "How is reading time calculated?",
      a: "Reading time is calculated based on average reading speeds. We use 400 characters/minute for Japanese and 250 words/minute for English. This is an estimate as individual reading speeds vary.",
    },
    {
      q: "Which languages are supported?",
      a: "Major languages including Japanese, English, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and French are supported. Language-optimized analysis is performed for each.",
    },
    {
      q: "How are words counted?",
      a: "Appropriate word segmentation is performed based on the language. English uses space delimiters, while Japanese recognizes groups of hiragana, katakana, kanji, and alphanumeric characters as words.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is text complexity determined?",
      a: "Text complexity is determined based on average words per sentence. For Japanese: under 15 words is simple, 15-25 words is moderate, over 25 words is complex.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I export the statistics?",
      a: "Yes. You can download statistics as text files (.txt) or JSON format. This is convenient for data storage and integration with other tools.",

      q: "Is my input text stored?",
