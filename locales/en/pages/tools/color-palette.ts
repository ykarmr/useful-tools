      q: "What is color theory?",
      a: "Color theory is a set of principles used to create harmonious color combinations. It includes concepts like complementary, analogous, and triadic colors that help create visually appealing and balanced color palettes.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between HEX, RGB, and HSL?",
      a: "HEX uses hexadecimal notation (#FF0000), RGB uses red-green-blue values (rgb(255,0,0)), and HSL uses hue-saturation-lightness (hsl(0,100%,50%)). Each format serves different purposes in design and development.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is color blind simulation?",
      a: "Color blind simulation shows how colors appear to people with different types of color vision deficiency. This helps ensure your design is accessible to all users.",
    },
    {
      q: "How can I use the generated palettes?",
      a: "Generated palettes can be used for web design, graphic design, branding, presentations, and more. You can export them as CSS variables or JSON for direct use in development projects.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is a monochromatic palette?",
      a: "A monochromatic palette uses variations of a single hue by changing its brightness and saturation. It creates elegant, cohesive designs with subtle variations.",
    },
  ],
